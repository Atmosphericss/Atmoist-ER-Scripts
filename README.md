ParamPatcher v3 Elden Ring Scripts 

Hi just wanted to make one place where I can upload my work as well as other creators work in one place where people can easily download it. I will try to credit anyone elses work I may post, as well as if I built on someone elses work to make any of my scripts.

I think it's pretty hard for new people to find scripts to try out in the Hexinton server, chats are flooded with lots of great activity.

Please do not steal other people's work and try to portray it as your own. I know no one is making money from this, but that's even more of a reason to just give a nod to the original creator/not to just repost someone elses stuff. If you see your script on here and would like it removed, contact me AtmoistðŸ–¤âš¡ðŸ’›#0001 and I will remove it ASAP. I'm only trying to post public scripts already found in ppv3 share area in hexinton disc, as well as my own stuff :)
